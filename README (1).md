# üß† Basal Ganglia Action Selection with FUS Modulation  
**Interactive simulation built in Nengo and Jupyter/Colab**

This project models how the **basal ganglia (BG)** select between competing cortical actions and how **focused ultrasound (FUS)** can transiently bias that process ‚Äî analogous to attenuation of corticostriatal drive in the **anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC)** for OCD treatment.

The notebook provides sliders to control cortical input strength, FUS intensity, and timing, allowing live visualisation of the effects on BG and thalamic output.

## üîç Background

In the **cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC)** circuit, the basal ganglia inhibit all actions by default and selectively disinhibit the most salient one.  
By temporarily reducing cortical input to the striatum, FUS can shift this competition ‚Äî suppressing an overactive action channel and restoring normal gating.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

**Requirements**
- Python ‚â• 3.10  
- Jupyter / VS Code / Colab  
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`  

or install manually:
```bash
pip install nengo matplotlib ipywidgets scipy
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Quick Start

### Run locally (VS Code or Jupyter)
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/bg_fus_interactive.ipynb
```
or open the notebook in VS Code and run the cells.  
Use the sliders to adjust:
- **A1**, **A2** ‚Äì cortical drive to each action  
- **Œ∫ (kappa)** ‚Äì FUS attenuation strength  
- **FUS start**, **duration** ‚Äì stimulation timing

## üß© What to Observe

| Phase | Expected behaviour |
|-------|--------------------|
| **Pre-FUS** | Stronger cortical input dominates; one BG channel disinhibited. |
| **During FUS** | Affected channel‚Äôs input attenuated ‚Üí competing channel may win. |
| **Post-FUS** | Normal competition resumes; thalamic outputs stabilise. |

## üå± Next Steps
- Add realistic **FUS pulse trains** or **PRF-locked modulation**.  
- Extend to 3‚Äì4 cortical actions or oscillatory inputs.  
- Derive **EEG-like readouts** for experimental predictions.  
- Couple the model to higher-level cognitive simulations.
